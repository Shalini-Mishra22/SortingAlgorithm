A Sorting Visualizer web application that demonstrates various sorting algorithms using bars to represent elements in an array. This project allows users to visualize the process of sorting in real-time, making it easier to understand how different sorting algorithms work.


## Features

- Visualize popular sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - selectio Sort
  - Insertion Sort (you can add more algorithms)

- Random array generation: Users can generate a new random array to sort.

- Real-time visualization: The sorting process is visually represented through animated bars, making it easy to follow along.

## Live Demo
